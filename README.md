# CS205 Course Project: Ultimate Super Badass Matrix Computer For Your Fxxking Bloody 16th DDL

​	A matrix computer,

​	Whos a simple computer,

​	But beyond imagination,

​	Till the end of time,

​	A whole mess.

## Structure

​	Folder `src` for source code, `test` for unit test module.

​	Now in progress of finishing course requirement.

## Future Plan

1. Find parallel or OpenMP way to speed up computation, CUDA may be another way.
2. If previous is done, and time is spare. Write a benchmark to show off with those slow computers.
3. Find MPI way to design distributed system computation.
4. Use web as front-end, a framework called `OpenCMS` (why all of them add `open` in prefix?) may be helpful.
